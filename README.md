From npm init to full deployment — WondaLast is more than just a hotel booking app. It's where users explore, review, and list hotels on an interactive map.
But behind the UI? A whirlwind of backend logic, cookie flows, secure sessions, and dynamic maps — all stitched together through sleepless nights and dozens of console logs. 😅
🧠 What I Built

All with route protection, session handling, and clean error feedback — even for APIs like Hoppscotch/Postman.
